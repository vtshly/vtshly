### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> I decided to create a new github account to replace the [old one](https://github.com/strannik46). There were only commits to private repositories anyway.

Here's what's interesting in my Github activity:

## QA-utilities
* I created a repo with my [QA-utilities](https://github.com/vtshly/QA-utilities) developments from my previous job at fintech company


## My Bug-reports and PR to Open-Source software
* [Bug report](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/5682) to [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) (Free Open Source Note-taking Software)
* Another [Bug report](https://github.com/vyleung/logseq-time-tracker-plugin/issues/8) for logseq plugin (time-tracker)
* Opened PR for [awesome-dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/awesome-dendron) repo with useful links for vs-code note-taking system [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) 
* Actively contributed to the [translation](https://crowdin.com/project/zettel-notes/ru) of the Android App [Zettel Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eu.thedoc.zettelnotes)
