### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> I decided to create a new github account to replace the [old one](https://github.com/strannik46). There were only commits to private repositories anyway.

Here's what's interesting in my repos:
* [Bug report](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/5682) created by me to [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) (Free Open Source Note-taking Software)
* Another my [Bug report](https://github.com/vyleung/logseq-time-tracker-plugin/issues/8) this time for logseq plugin (time-tracker)
* Opened PR for [awesome-dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/awesome-dendron) repo with useful links for vs-code note-taking system [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)

I also want to create a new repo with my QA-utilits developments from my previous job at fintech company
